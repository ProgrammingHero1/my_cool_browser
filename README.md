# Advanced-Browser
An Advanced version of Simple Browser and has no errors and you can do it with any code editor

Put this in the terminal of your python project:

```
pip install PyQt5
pip install PyQtWebEngine
```

After you have done that step then copy and paste the code into your code editor from main.py

If you need any help or have issues write it in the issues section.

Feel free to change anything with the code
